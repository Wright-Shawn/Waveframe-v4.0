  "description": "Waveframe v4.0 is a proof-of-concept cosmological framework built via a multi-threaded, AI-assisted research workflow with continuous human validation. It explores an entropy\u2013action, observer-driven expansion law (H(t) \u221d 1/\u221a(t \u2212 t\u2080), S(t) = \u03c0 / H(t)\u00b2) and compares it to \u039bCDM using locally run Python numerics. This release is intended for portfolio demonstration of AI Workflow Designer skills, parallel prompt orchestration, and reproducible independent research.",
