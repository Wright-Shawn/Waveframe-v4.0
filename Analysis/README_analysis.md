# Analysis — Waveframe v4.0

This folder records the local theory–theory comparison between **Waveframe v4.0 (γ = 0.05)** and **ΛCDM**.

**Contents**
- `01_results_summary.md` — narrative results summary with transparency notes
- `02_LCDM_comparison.md` — side-by-side table and figure embeds
- `Figures/` — plots: `E(z) = H(z):H0.png`, `Angular Diameter Distance D_A(z).png`, `Growth_D(z).png`
- `waveframe_v_lcdm_local_analysis.csv` — numerical outputs used in the analysis

**Method Notes**
Calculations were run locally (no CAMB/CLASS, no external datasets). CMB/BAO shifts are distance-only proxies; a full Boltzmann run would refine them. This is a proof-of-concept meant to showcase AI workflow orchestration and reproducible documentation.
