# Version History — Waveframe v4.0

2025-08-12 — Rename: Waveframe XR → Waveframe v4.0

## Summary of Change:
The project formerly referred to as Waveframe XR is now officially titled Waveframe v4.0, keeping version naming consistent across releases and avoiding confusion with unrelated fields.

## Reasoning:
	•	The “XR” suffix was originally meant to mean “Extended Reality” of the observer framework, but in technology circles it’s strongly tied to AR/VR.
	•	Through self-review, I realized this could mislead people into thinking the project is about graphics or virtual reality instead of theoretical cosmology.
	•	Changing to v4.0 keeps the identity clear and in line with earlier versions.

## Impact on Scope and Methods:
	•	No changes were made to the actual equations, code logic, or project goals.
	•	All files and notes have been updated to use Waveframe v4.0 instead of Waveframe XR.
	•	Old versions are still available so anyone can see the full development history.

## Continuity Notes:
	•	In earlier documents, “continuing in XR” just means continuing into the current v4.0 stage.
	•	The project still focuses on observer-driven cosmology and information-first geometry, just under the updated name.
