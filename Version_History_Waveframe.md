# Version History — Waveframe v4.0

## 2025-08-12 — Rename: "Waveframe XR" → "Waveframe v4.0"

**Summary of Change:**  
The project formerly referred to as *Waveframe XR* is now officially titled **Waveframe v4.0**.  
This change was made to unify version naming across all releases and avoid confusion with unrelated fields.

**Reasoning:**  
- The “XR” suffix, while originally intended to stand for “Extended Reality” of the observer framework, carries strong associations with *Extended Reality* in computer science and AR/VR technology.  
- Feedback and self-review suggested that the XR label could mislead readers into thinking the project was related to computer graphics, virtual reality, or simulation platforms.  
- Since the core work is in **theoretical cosmology** rather than **computer science or AR/VR**, the name has been standardized to **v4.0** to maintain clarity and continuity with previous Waveframe releases.

**Impact on Scope and Methodology:**  
- **No changes** were made to the scientific model, derivations, or objectives.  
- All prior references to *Waveframe XR* in documentation, code, and notes have been updated to *Waveframe v4.0*.  
- Archived versions remain under their original names for historical accuracy, but any forward-looking development, publication, or discussion will use the v4.0 designation.

**Continuity Notes:**  
- Readers may encounter references to *continuing in XR* in earlier documents, especially in Waveframe v3.1 discussions. These should now be interpreted as referring to **v4.0**.  
- The project continues its focus on observer-driven cosmology and information-first geometry under the unified v4.0 banner.
