# Workflow Log — Waveframe v4.0

## Purpose
This log documents the build process for Waveframe v4.0.  
The focus is not the physics itself, but how the project demonstrates **AI Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** in practice: transparent decisions, reproducibility, and auditability.  

Each entry answers *what happened, when, and why* so the repo can be read as a proof-of-concept for AWO.  

---

## Phase 1 — Defining Scope *(Late July 2025)*
- Clarified end goal: Waveframe v4.0 = **flagship AWO proof-of-concept**, not just another physics repo.  
- Assessed risks: technical physics claims might distract, so emphasis shifted to documenting the **workflow itself**.  
- Decision: treat physics as the case study, AWO as the product.  

**Skills demonstrated:** project framing, goal alignment, roadmap planning  

---

## Phase 2 — Building the Method Frame *(Aug 3, 31 commits)*
- Drafted the “Meta Method” paper outline to contextualize AWO.  
- Connected Waveframe to methodology: every physics step doubles as an **audit trail for AWO**.  
- Repo structure mirrored AWO principles: `/theory`, `/figures`, `/logs`, reproducibility artifacts.  

**Skills demonstrated:** workflow orchestration, academic structuring, methodological design  

---

## Phase 3 — Metadata and DOIs *(Aug 10, 94 commits)*
- Minted DOI via Zenodo: **10.5281/zenodo.16872200**.  
- Integrated DOI badge into README.  
- Drafted and validated `CITATION.cff`.  
- Verified GitHub “Cite this repository” integration.  
- **Failure logged:** initial pre-release flagged by Zenodo → fixed by re-publishing properly.  

**Skills demonstrated:** reproducibility infrastructure, scholarly publishing, troubleshooting  

---

## Phase 4 — Licensing Decisions *(Aug 10, continued)*
- Evaluated options:  
  - Apache 2.0 → permissive, allows commercial use  
  - GPLv3 → copyleft, commercial use allowed  
  - CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 → non-commercial, share-alike, attribution required  
- **Decision:** adopt **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** for this proof-of-concept to show AWO can enforce **IP strategy** as part of workflow.  
- Outcome: GitHub shows “unknown licenses” warning (tradeoff accepted, documented here).  

**Skills demonstrated:** intellectual property strategy, workflow transparency  

---

## Phase 5 — Documentation & Accessibility *(Aug 17, 73 commits)*
- Compared LaTeX vs Unicode Markdown.  
- Decision: use Markdown for recruiter readability + GitHub-native auditability.  
- Figures stored in `/figures` with dated filenames → visual audit trail.  
- README explicitly framed project as **AWO case study**.  

**Skills demonstrated:** documentation strategy, accessibility, reproducibility logging  

---

## Phase 6 — Release Engineering *(Aug 24, 24 commits)*
- Synced GitHub release with Zenodo (pre-release issue resolved).  
- Finalized `CITATION.cff` with version, DOI, and ORCID.  
- README updated with DOI badge, dual licensing, and clear AWO framing.  
- Reflection section added: value = reproducibility + auditability.  

**Skills demonstrated:** release engineering, reproducibility practices, auditability demonstration  

---

## Phase 7 — Current Status *(End of August 2025)*
- Repo is **not yet archived** → currently polishing artifacts like this log.  
- Next tasks:  
  - Backfill ADRs (`/decisions`) for key tradeoffs.  
  - Ensure `WORKFLOW_LOG.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` both reflect reproducibility focus.  
  - Prepare final reflection linking Waveframe explicitly back to AWO framework.  

**Skills demonstrated:** ongoing polish, process transparency, audit preparation  

---

## Deliverables So Far
- DOI minted and integrated  
- `CITATION.cff` validated and GitHub-recognized  
- Dual licensing strategy documented  
- Figures + logs maintained  
- README reframed to emphasize AWO as proof-of-concept  

---

## Summary
Waveframe v4.0 is a **living proof-of-concept for AI Workflow Orchestration (AWO)**.  
Physics serves as the testbed, but the contribution lies in documenting a **transparent, reproducible, auditable workflow**.  

Every decision — from licensing to failed DOI attempts — is captured here so the repo can be picked up by outsiders (recruiters, researchers) without extra explanation. Archival will come later, once polish is complete.
