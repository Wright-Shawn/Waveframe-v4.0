# Workflow Log — Waveframe v4.0

**Purpose:**  
This workflow log documents the chronological steps taken to build and finalize the Waveframe v4.0 release.  
It is intended as both a research diary and a transparent record of the AI-assisted process.  

---

## Phase 1 — Project Scope and Goals
- Defined end goal: build credibility as an independent researcher with a published, citable cosmology project.  
- Established viability: current progress (repos, DOIs, documentation) is strong; risks lie in recognition and focus.  
- Decision: anchor on Waveframe v4.0 as the flagship “proof-of-concept” release.  

---

## Phase 2 — Meta Method Framework
- Concept introduced: **Meta Method** = formal paper on the methodology itself.  
- Structure drafted: abstract, motivation, method, case study (Waveframe), implications.  
- Positioning: Meta Method will follow Waveframe to contextualize the research approach.  

---

## Phase 3 — DOI and Citations
- DOI minted through Zenodo: **10.5281/zenodo.16872200**.  
- DOI badge generated for README.  
- `CITATION.cff` drafted with author info, ORCID, DOI, and release metadata.  
- Verification: GitHub recognizes `CITATION.cff` for “Cite this repository.”  

---

## Phase 4 — Licensing
- Researcher’s priority: prevent commercial exploitation.  
- Options reviewed:  
  - Apache 2.0 → permissive, commercial use allowed.  
  - GPLv3 → open source enforcement, commercial use allowed.  
  - CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 → non-commercial, share-alike, attribution required.  
- Decision: adopt **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** (manual inclusion since GitHub dropdown lacks it).  

---

## Phase 5 — Documentation Format
- Question: LaTeX vs Unicode for repo files.  
- Decision: Unicode for accessibility, recruiter readability, and GitHub rendering.  
- Action: README and supporting files generated in Markdown with Unicode formatting.  

---

## Phase 6 — Finalization Steps
- Pre-release flag unchecked on GitHub release to ensure Zenodo sync.  
- Figures prepared and added to repo under `/figures`.  
- `CITATION.cff` finalized with DOI, ORCID, license, and repository link.  
- README updated with DOI badge, license, and author identity.  
- Reflection section added to capture methodology value.  

---

## Phase 7 — Archival and Next Steps
- Repository archived as **Waveframe v4.0 (Proof-of-Concept Release)**.  
- Identified next project: **Societal Progress Simulator** (wrightsocietalmodel.com).  
- Established long-term roadmap: finalize Waveframe → Meta Method → simulator → public-facing rollout.  

---

**Summary:**  
Waveframe v4.0 was completed and archived as a **portfolio-ready cosmological framework**, with proper licensing, DOI, citation, and documentation.  
The workflow illustrates a replicable, AI-assisted research process designed to produce **citable, independent scholarship**.
