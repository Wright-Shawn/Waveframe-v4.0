# Theoretical Framework — Waveframe V4.0

## Purpose
This document outlines the conceptual and mathematical foundations of the Waveframe V4.0 model — an entropy–action cosmology that unites scalar-field cosmologies (v1.0–v2.0), entropy-driven models (v3.x), and ΛCDM under a single formal structure.

## 1. Conceptual Core
Waveframe V4.0 starts from the principle that **geometry is not fundamental**. Instead, the observable universe emerges from the flow of **observer-limited information** across causal horizons.  
The key axiom is that **horizon entropy governs expansion**, replacing the metric tensor as the primary dynamical object.

- **Observer-defined horizons** are information boundaries, not static metric surfaces.
- **Spacetime emergence** results from entropy gradients and information acquisition.
- **Expansion = Rendering Rate** — Hubble parameter encodes the rate at which spacetime is “rendered” by information intake.

## 2. Mathematical Foundations

### 2.1 Horizon Entropy–Hubble Relation
From Bekenstein–Hawking scaling in de Sitter space:
```
S ∝ 1 / H²
```
Waveframe extends this to arbitrary H(t) as:
```
S(t) = π / [H(t)]²
```
This reinterprets S(t) as **observer-accessible entropy**, not global horizon entropy.

### 2.2 Entropy Growth Law
In Waveframe V4.0, the entropy growth rate is a general function:
```
dS/dt = α(t)
```
where α(t) is the **entropy acquisition rate** — the fundamental driver of cosmic expansion.

### 2.3 Master Equation for H(t)
Differentiating S(t) and substituting:
```
dH/dt = - α(t) / (2π) * H³
```
This ODE defines the background expansion history for any choice of α(t).

### 2.4 General Integral Solution
```
1 / [H(t)]² = 1 / H₀² + (1/π) ∫ α(u) du
```
This makes α(t) the fundamental predictive object of the theory.

## 3. Recovery of Known Models

### ΛCDM Limit
Choosing α(t) to match the ΛCDM expansion history during early times ensures observational viability at BBN and recombination.

### Scalar-Field Models (v1.0–v2.0)
By constraining α(t) according to scalar-field oscillations, the earlier dynamics are reproduced.

### Entropy-Driven Cosmology (v3.x)
A constant α recovers the pure informational expansion model of v3.x.

## 4. Predictions and Tests

- **Distance–Redshift Relation**: Computed via standard cosmological integrals using H(z) from α(t).
- **Growth of Structure**: Perturbation equations evolve with the modified H(z).
- **Late-Time Deviations**: Controlled departures from ΛCDM at low redshift are testable with SN Ia, BAO, and RSD data.

## 5. Philosophical Implications
Waveframe V4.0 bridges thermodynamics, information theory, and observational cosmology:
- Positions observation as the cause of expansion, not a passive recording.
- Embeds geometry within information flow.
- Suggests that cosmology is fundamentally about entropy acquisition histories, not spacetime curvature.

## 6. Summary Statement
Waveframe V4.0 is a unifying entropy–action cosmology, capable of recovering ΛCDM, scalar-field models, and pure entropy cosmologies within a single, falsifiable mathematical structure.  
Its predictive power rests entirely on the specification of α(t), the entropy acquisition rate, which can be directly tested against observational data.
