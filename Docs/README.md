# Documentation — Waveframe v4.0

This folder contains supporting documentation for the Waveframe v4.0 project.  
These files explain the theoretical foundations, workflow, validation criteria, and project history.

## Contents

### 1. `Theoretical_Framework.md`
Defines the conceptual and mathematical basis of Waveframe v4.0, including entropy–action dynamics and deviations from ΛCDM.

### 2. `Falsifiability.md`
Outlines the falsifiability criteria applied to the model.  
Includes testable predictions, pass/fail conditions, and how they are implemented in the notebooks.

### 3. `Workflow_Log.md`
Chronological record of the research process, including design decisions, revisions, and key milestones.

### 4. `Version_History.md`
Summarizes changes across Waveframe releases (v2.0, v3.0, v3.1, v4.0).  
Highlights scope adjustments and major theoretical updates.

### 5. `Dialogue_Excerpt_Extended.md`
Extended excerpts of AI–human dialogue that illustrate the research workflow and orchestration process.  
Provides context for the methodology underlying this project.

## Usage Notes
- These documents are **complementary to the main README**.  
- Technical implementation (code, equations, notebooks) is found in other folders.  
- For citation purposes, please see the root `CITATION.cff` file.

## Maintenance
- Update **`Workflow_Log.md`** continuously as progress is made.  
- Add new falsifiability criteria to **`Falsifiability.md`** when predictions are refined.  
- Record version changes in **`Version_History.md`** at each tagged release.
