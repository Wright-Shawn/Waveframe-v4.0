# Version History: Waveframe Hypothesis v1.0 → v4.0

This document outlines the evolution of the Waveframe Hypothesis, culminating in the fully unified **Waveframe v4.0**.

---

## v1.0 & v2.0 — Scalar-Field Cosmologies  
- Early versions featuring oscillatory behaviors driven by scalar fields.  
- Based on phenomenological scalar dynamics, without explicit entropy or information-theoretic foundations.

## v3.x — Entropy-Driven Models  
- Introduced the notion of **observer-defined entropy** and **emergent horizons**.  
- Removed reliance on metric geometry, exploring expansion as a consequence of entropy growth.  
- Emphasized minimal assumptions, offering direct falsifiable predictions like entropy discontinuities and rendering asymmetries.

## v4.0 — Entropy–Action Cosmology  
- Unifies all prior versions under a single **entropy–action principle**.  
- Demonstrates that:
  - v1.0–v2.0 scalar-field models and  
  - v3.x entropy-first models  
  emerge as **special limits** of the more general framework.  
- Extends the model’s scope to **recover ΛCDM**, **embed earlier scalar dynamics**, and maintain **predictive falsifiability** based on information-theoretic foundations.

## Why This Matters  
Waveframe v4.0 is not merely a new iteration—it’s the parent theory.  
It bridges phenomenological cosmology, information theory, and observational constraints into a streamlined, falsifiable foundation.
