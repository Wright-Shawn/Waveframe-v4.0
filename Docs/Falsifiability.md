# Falsifiability Criteria — Waveframe V4.0

## Purpose
To define clear, testable conditions under which the Waveframe V4.0 entropy–action cosmology will be considered falsified.  
These criteria ensure the model is scientifically accountable and distinguishable from ΛCDM or other existing frameworks.

---

## 1. Early-Universe Agreement (BBN & CMB)
**Requirement:**  
Waveframe V4.0 must reproduce the expansion history of ΛCDM to within observational uncertainties during:
- **Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)** — Temperature range 0.1–10 MeV.
- **Recombination epoch** — Redshift z ≈ 1100.

**Test:**  
- Compute H(t) from the chosen α(t) parameterization.
- Compare to H_ΛCDM(t) over the above epochs.
- Pass condition: |H(t) - H_ΛCDM(t)| / H_ΛCDM(t) ≤ 5%.

**Falsification:**  
If deviations exceed 5% in these epochs, predicted light-element abundances or CMB acoustic peak positions will not match observations.

## 2. Distance–Redshift Relation (Supernovae & BAO)
**Requirement:**  
The model’s luminosity distance D_L(z) and angular diameter distance D_A(z) must match current high-quality datasets.

**Test:**  
- Use Pantheon+ SN Ia sample for D_L(z).
- Use BAO measurements for D_A(z) and H(z).
- Pass condition: χ²/d.o.f ≤ 1.2 for combined SN Ia + BAO fit.

**Falsification:**  
Significant systematic deviation in the residuals, particularly redshift-dependent trends inconsistent with ΛCDM, falsifies the model.

## 3. Growth of Cosmic Structure (fσ₈)
**Requirement:**  
Predicted linear growth rate fσ₈(z) must match current large-scale structure surveys.

**Test:**  
- Integrate linear perturbation growth equation using H(z) from the model.
- Compare to RSD (redshift-space distortion) data.
- Pass condition: Agreement within 2σ of current fσ₈(z) data points.

**Falsification:**  
If predicted growth rates are systematically too high/low across redshift bins.

---

## 4. Parameter Economy
**Requirement:**  
Waveframe V4.0 must not require more free parameters than ΛCDM to achieve equal or worse fits.

**Test:**  
- Count free parameters in α(t) parameterization.
- Compare Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) against ΛCDM.

**Falsification:**  
If BIC difference ΔBIC ≥ +6 (strong evidence against Waveframe) with no compensating theoretical advantage.

---

## 5. Unique Predictions
**Requirement:**  
The model must yield at least one testable late-time deviation from ΛCDM.

**Examples:**  
- Specific H(z) slope change at z < 0.5.
- Scale-dependent growth rate departures in fσ₈.
- Observable CMB low-ℓ anomalies tied to rendering asymmetry.

**Falsification:**  
If the chosen α(t) parameterization collapses exactly to ΛCDM across all observables, the model loses independent predictive value.

---

## 6. Internal Consistency
**Requirement:**  
All derived quantities (S(t), α(t), H(t), a(t), z(t)) must remain mathematically consistent and respect thermodynamic constraints.

**Test:**  
- Verify dS/dt ≥ 0 at all times.
- Verify α(t) is finite and continuous (or piecewise with physical transitions).

**Falsification:**  
If entropy decreases (dS/dt < 0) in physical regimes without justified exotic physics.

---

## Conclusion
Passing all tests does not “prove” Waveframe V4.0, but failing any **single falsifiability criterion** above renders the model observationally invalid in its current form.  
The model is only viable if it remains consistent with early-universe constraints, current distance and growth data, and offers unique, testable departures from ΛCDM.
