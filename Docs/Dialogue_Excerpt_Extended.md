# Extended Dialogue Excerpt — Waveframe v4.0 Research Workflow

**Context:**  
This extended transcript captures a broader set of exchanges from the AI-assisted workflow used to develop Waveframe v4.0.  
Purpose: to provide a transparent demonstration of the iterative, researcher-driven dialogue shaping the project.

### Excerpts

**Researcher:**  
> What’s your honest assessment of my end goal? Is it viable with the work I’ve already done or am I overshooting?  

**AI Collaborator:**  
> You’re not overshooting. Your end goal — building credibility as an independent researcher, publishing Waveframe, rolling it out with supporting works — is viable.  
>  
> Where you’re strong: version-controlled repos, DOIs, documentation. Where the risk is: recognition and focus.  
>  
> My call: finish Waveframe v4.0 cleanly. That anchors everything else.

**Researcher:**  
> What’s the Meta Method?  

**AI Collaborator:**  
> It’s the framework that explains how you’re doing science outside institutions — the “science of how you’re doing science.”  
>  
> Formal paper outline:  
> - Abstract  
> - Motivation (limits of institutional science)  
> - Method (AI-assisted, recursive workflow)  
> - Case Study (Waveframe)  
> - Implications.

**Researcher:**  
> I have the DOI now. What’s next?  

**AI Collaborator:**  
> Perfect. Add the badge to your README:  
> ```markdown
> [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16872200.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16872200)
> ```  
> Then generate `CITATION.cff` so GitHub’s “Cite this repository” pulls your ORCID and DOI automatically.  

---

**Researcher:**  
> I don’t want anyone profiting off of this. Which license should I use?  

**AI Collaborator:**  
> Apache 2.0 is permissive — anyone could commercialize it. If you want to block that:  
> - **GPLv3** keeps it open source, forces derivatives to stay open, but still allows commercial use.  
> - **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** blocks commercial use entirely.  
>  
> Since your priority is “no profit hijacking,” CC BY-NC-SA is the best fit. We’ll add that manually.  

---

**Researcher:**  
> I’ve edited the `CITATION.cff` manually. Would you check it?  

**AI Collaborator:**  
> Looks solid. Add quotes around the DOI, simplify version to `4.0`, and include `repository-code:` for best practice. That way GitHub, Zenodo, and reference managers pick it up cleanly.  

---

**Researcher:**  
> This is LaTeX. Do you think we should build the repo using LaTeX or Unicode?  

**AI Collaborator:**  
> For portfolio impact, Unicode is better. LaTeX looks academic but can create friction for recruiters or collaborators who just want to skim. Unicode keeps it clean, portable, and GitHub-renderable.  

---

**Researcher:**  
> Do I need to do another release to trigger Zenodo after unchecking prerelease?  

**AI Collaborator:**  
> No — once you uncheck prerelease, Zenodo will pick it up. The key is that your GitHub release is flagged as “latest” and not a draft. Zenodo listens for that.  

---

**Researcher:**  
> Where am I putting the BibTeX citation exactly?  

**AI Collaborator:**  
> Keep your `CITATION.cff` in the root so GitHub parses it. Then also add the BibTeX block to your README under a “Citation” section. That way it’s visible immediately but still machine-readable for tools.  

---

**Researcher:**  
> Should I add my ORCID to the README before archiving?  

**AI Collaborator:**  
> Yes. Add it alongside your author name at the top or in a “Credits” section. That reinforces authorship and ties your GitHub work to your scholarly identity.  

---

**Researcher:**  
> I think we’re ready to move on to the next project.  

**AI Collaborator:**  
> Agreed. With the DOI, license, figures, and citation finalized, Waveframe v4.0 is locked. Archive it cleanly and pivot energy toward the Societal Model project.

### Reflection

This extended excerpt demonstrates the **Monday Method** in practice:  
- Researcher provides scope, goals, and editorial control.  
- AI collaborator supplies analysis, technical scaffolding, and compliance checks.  
- Together, the output is formalized into **repositories, licenses, DOIs, and citable artifacts**.  

Waveframe v4.0 therefore illustrates not just a cosmological framework but also a repeatable model for **AI-assisted independent research**.
