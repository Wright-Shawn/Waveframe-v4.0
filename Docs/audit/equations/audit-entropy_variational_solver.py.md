# Waveframe v4.0 Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-09-08  
**Auditor Model:** GPT-5 (manual prompt)  
**Scope:** Final audit of `equations/entropy_variational_solver.py`  

---

## 1. Falsifiability & Scientific Rigor
- [PASS] The equations being solved are explicitly stated in the docstring and can be numerically tested.  
- [PASS] $\alpha(t)$ is implemented as a user-supplied function, making the solver falsifiable by plugging in different models.  

---

## 2. Accuracy of Math & Results
- [PASS] Differential equations implemented match the stated forms:  

$$
\frac{dH}{dt} = - \frac{\alpha(t)}{2\pi} H^3
$$  

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = \alpha(t)
$$  

$$
\frac{da}{dt} = aH
$$  

- [PASS] Initial conditions for $H$, $S$, and $a$ are consistent with cosmological conventions.  
- [NOTE] Constant $2\pi$ is hard-coded via `PI = np.pi`; ensure normalization matches theory (avoid factor of $4\pi$ ambiguity).  

---

## 3. Coherence & Logical Flow
- [PASS] Clear, modular function `integrate_background_time()` with parameters and outputs documented.  
- [PASS] Arguments ($H_0$, $S_0$, $\alpha(t)$) map directly to theory definitions.  

---

## 4. Structural & Logistical Issues
- [PASS] Uses `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, an appropriate solver.  
- [NOTE] Return dictionary keys (`H`, `S`, `a`) should be explicitly documented in the docstring.  

---

## 5. Formatting & Presentation
- [PASS] Docstring includes equations in readable Unicode math form.  
- [PASS] Function parameters and return values documented in NumPy/SciPy style.  
- [NOTE] Could add example usage block to guide new users.  

---

## Summary
**Result:** Implementation is correct and consistent with theoretical equations.  
**Revisions Implemented/Planned:**  
- Add explicit documentation for return dictionary keys.  
- Optional: include usage example in docstring.  
- No computational errors detected.  

**Recommendation:** Accept with minor docstring improvements for clarity.
