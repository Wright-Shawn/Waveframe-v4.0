# Waveframe v4.0 Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-09-08  
**Auditor Model:** GPT-5 (manual prompt)  
**Scope:** Final audit of `equations/01_entropy_action_derivation.md`  

---

## 1. Falsifiability & Scientific Rigor
- [PASS] Axioms and assumptions are explicitly stated and distinguishable as Waveframe-specific vs. mainstream.  
- [NOTE] Axiom 4 (“Hubble flow is a measure of entropy acquisition rate”) is phrased as a definitional postulate.  
  - Revision: Clarified as an *operational measure* with falsifiability condition $H(t) \propto dS/dt$.  

---

## 2. Accuracy of Math & Results
- [PASS] Horizon entropy definition (Bekenstein–Hawking) correctly given as proportional to horizon area.  
- [PASS] Intermediate substitutions into Hubble parameter relations are consistent.  
- [FAIL] In the transition from entropy–area relation to entropy–action formalism, one derivation step was skipped.  
  - Revision: Added explicit proportionality constant $\kappa$ in $I \propto \int S \,(dS/dt)\,dt$.  

---

## 3. Coherence & Logical Flow
- [PASS] Argument proceeds from axioms → horizon entropy → entropy growth law → expansion law.  
- [NOTE] The leap from “entropy growth rate $\leftrightarrow$ Hubble flow” to the final law lacked an intermediate equation.  
  - Revision: Inserted explicit differential step $-\tfrac{2\pi H'(t)}{H(t)^3} = \alpha$.  

---

## 4. Structural & Logistical Issues
- [PASS] Section order coherent: purpose → axioms → derivation.  
- [NOTE] “Observer entropy” introduced without prior definition.  
  - Revision: Added definition $S_{\text{obs}}(t) = \pi/H(t)^2$.  

---

## 5. Formatting & Presentation
- [PASS] Unicode math symbols render correctly (e.g. $R_H = c/H$, $dS/dt$).  
- [PASS] Clear use of [Mainstream], [Waveframe Axiom], [Waveframe Result] tags.  
- [NOTE] Some inline equations were less readable.  
  - Revision: Promoted entropy–area proportionality and key derivation steps to block equations.  

---

## Summary
**Result:** Mostly consistent derivation with minor clarity and rigor issues.  
**Revisions Implemented:**  
- Clarified falsifiability of Axiom 4.  
- Added proportionality justification in entropy–action formalism.  
- Explicitly defined “observer entropy.”  
- Inserted intermediate derivation equation.  
- Promoted inline relations to block equations.  

**Recommendation:** No further changes required for Waveframe v4.0 release.
