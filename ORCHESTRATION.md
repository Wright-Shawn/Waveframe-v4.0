# AI Orchestration — How Waveframe v4.0 Was Built

This document makes the orchestration **explicit**. It shows how AI was directed, audited, and corrected to build the v4.0 proof‑of‑concept. The point is simple: *AI‑assisted development is the skill.*

## Scope

- Project: **Waveframe v4.0 — AI‑Orchestrated Proof of Concept in Cosmology**
- Goal: Demonstrate end‑to‑end AI‑assisted R&D: ideation → derivations → checks → packaging → release.
- Proof: Public repo, DOI, reproducible artifacts, and human‑validated reasoning.

## Artifacts of Record

- Timeline and gating decisions: see `docs/Workflow_Log.md` (chronological steps, risks, mitigations).
- Dialogue traces: see `docs/Dialogue_Excerpt_Extended.md` (prompt design, error catching, refactoring).
- Repository: structured version control, CI‑style checklists, and release notes (v4.0 tag).

> Why include raw dialogue? Because orchestration is a **repeatable method**, not a one‑off stunt. The dialogue shows planning pressure, red‑team prompts, and how missteps were corrected in flight.

## Operating Model

**Roles**  
- *Human (Principal Investigator):* sets targets, rejects fluff, enforces falsifiability, owns final edits.  
- *AI (Multiple Models):* generate drafts, propose derivations, critique claims, produce figures/code, and self‑review with adversarial prompts.

**Control Loop**  
1. Frame the unit of work (what “done” looks like).  
2. Draft → critique → redraft (multi‑pass).  
3. Sanity checks (dimensionality, boundary cases, null tests).  
4. Package into repo artifacts (figures, docs, scripts).  
5. Release gating (checklist + human sign‑off).

**Quality Bar**  
- No metaphysical hand‑waving: every claim needs a derivation path or an explicit TODO.  
- Prefer explicit equations and testable predictions.  
- Document assumptions and trade‑offs.

## Concrete Examples (from the record)

- **Parallel Prompt Orchestration:** distinct threads for derivations, predictions, repo docs, and critique.  
- **Error Capture:** AI proposed a path; dialogue thread flagged inconsistencies; fix recorded in `docs/Dialogue_Excerpt_Extended.md`.  
- **Packaging Discipline:** workflow log shows when artifacts were frozen and why (scope control).

## Transferable Skill for Employers

- I can **design and drive** AI workflows that ship.  
- I convert ambiguous goals into artifacts a reviewer can audit.  
- I keep the signal‑to‑noise high: short loops, hard gates, and explicit handoffs.  
- I can apply the same orchestration to analytics, reporting, and apps (see `demos/`).

## What’s Next

- Streamlit demo for interactive inspection of toy cosmology signals (`demos/streamlit_app.py`).  
- A lightweight report generator that turns model outputs into a brief, readable report (`demos/report_generator.py`).  
- Exploration of Langflow/Flowise for pipeline sketches (`demos/pipelines/langflow_waveframe_template.json`).
