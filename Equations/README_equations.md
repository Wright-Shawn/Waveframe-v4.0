# Equations Folder — Waveframe V4.0

## Purpose
This folder contains the mathematical derivations, computational formulas, and implementation scripts for the Waveframe V4.0 entropy–action cosmology.  
Each file here represents either a direct derivation from first principles or a code-based implementation for testing and comparison with observations.

---

## Current Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_entropy_action_derivation.md` | Full derivation of the entropy–action relationship and master equation governing H(t) in Waveframe V4.0. |

## Planned Additions

| Planned File | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `hubble_entropy_growth.py` | Compute H(z) directly from chosen α(t) parameterization. |
| `structure_growth.py` | Calculate linear growth factor and fσ₈(z) predictions. |
| `limit_case_LCDM.py` | Demonstrate explicit recovery of ΛCDM as a limit case. |
| `entropy_variational_solver.py` | Numerical solver for entropy–action field equations. |

## Usage
Derivations are provided in Markdown format for transparency and readability.  
Numerical scripts will be written in Python, with no external dependencies beyond standard scientific libraries (`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`).

When implementing or testing a derivation:
1. Read the corresponding `.md` file for theoretical context.
2. Run the matching `.py` file to reproduce numerical results or plots.
