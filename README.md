## Status

This repository is **archived as a completed proof-of-concept (v4.0)**.  
The work is permanently recorded via **DOI** for reproducibility.  

---

## What This Is

Waveframe v4.0 is a **workflow demonstration** applying  
**AI Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** to a complex scientific problem.  

- Physics content is **exploratory** — not a replacement for ΛCDM  
- The focus is on **reproducibility, transparency, and auditability**  
- Outputs are packaged like serious software: figures, notebooks, logs, decision records  

> Think of Waveframe v4.0 as a **case study in AI-assisted research orchestration**, not as a final cosmological model.

## Deliverables

- `/Theory` – Conceptual framework and derivations  
- `/Equations` – Equations and assumptions  
- `/Notebooks` – Python notebooks for model-vs-ΛCDM comparisons  
- `/Analysis` – Results summaries, figures, CSV outputs  
- `/Figures` – Generated plots (expansion history, growth factor, etc.)  
- `/Docs` – Supporting documentation (workflow, logs, falsifiability scaffolds)  
- `/Demos` – Lightweight apps (Streamlit, report generator)  
- `/decisions` – Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

More detailed discussion of the model, scaffolds for falsifiability, and empirical criteria can be found in  
**[`Docs/Extended_Methodology.md`](Docs/Extended_Methodology.md)**.

## Portfolio Note

This repository is part of a broader portfolio showing how **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** can scale across domains:

- [Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)](https://github.com/Wright-Shawn/Aurora-Workflow-Orchestration) — defines the orchestration framework    
- [Waveframe v4.0](https://github.com/Wright-Shawn/Waveframe-v4.0) — scientific case study
*Future projects: TBA*
