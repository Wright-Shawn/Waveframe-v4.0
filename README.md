## Overview

Waveframe v4.0 is a research project that demonstrates how **AI Workflow Orchestration (AWO)** can be applied to exploratory physics. The project uses cosmology as a case study, presenting an information and entropy driven model of expansion while emphasizing **methodology over theory**.  

This repository is not positioned as a finished cosmological framework. Instead, it serves as a **proof of process**: every claim, equation, and assumption is structured within a transparent, auditable, and reproducible workflow. By treating cosmology as an open testbed, Waveframe v4.0 demonstrates how independent researchers can conduct and preserve rigorous work with AI assisted methods.  

---

## Methodological Contribution

The primary contribution of Waveframe v4.0 lies in its **workflow design**:  

- **Transparency** — all orchestration decisions, prompts, and assumptions are captured in logs.  
- **Reproducibility** — runs are versioned and archived with permanent DOIs.  
- **Falsifiability** — explicit criteria for empirical testing are documented, even where derivations are incomplete.  
- **Neutrality** — the method is structured to remain independent of specific model providers.  

Waveframe v4.0 shows how AWO can support research beyond business applications by tackling a high uncertainty, theory heavy domain like cosmology.

## Core Framework Summary

Waveframe’s cosmological sketch is based on three central assumptions:

1. **Observer-defined horizons** — physical boundaries of accessible information, determined by what an observer can measure or interact with.  
2. **Entropy–area law** — entropy is proportional to horizon area, expressed as:  
   \[
   S(t) = \frac{\pi}{H(t)^2}
   \]  
3. **Entropy–action expansion** — assuming entropy grows monotonically with cosmic time, this motivates the minimal testable scaling law:  
   \[
   H(t) \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{t - t_0}}
   \]  

These are presented as **axiomatic hypotheses**, not derived results, and serve as a scaffold for falsifiability testing.

## Physics Case Study

The cosmological side of Waveframe explores whether expansion can be derived from an **entropy–action principle** rather than conventional spacetime geometry.  

Key features include:  

- Entropy defined as \( S(t) = \pi / H(t)^2 \), tying horizon area to information content.  
- A proposed expansion law \( H(t) \propto 1/\sqrt{t - t_0} \), explored as a testable alternative to ΛCDM scaling.  
- Observer defined horizons as the foundation for cosmological dynamics.  

These proposals are intentionally framed as **hypotheses**, not completed derivations. They are presented to illustrate how scaffolding, falsifiability, and reproducibility can be built into early stage theoretical work.  

For a runnable illustration of the falsifiability scaffolds, see [equations/Waveframe_Scaling.ipynb](equations/Waveframe_Scaling.ipynb).

## Scope and Limitations

- This project does **not** provide a full replacement for ΛCDM.  
- Derivations are partial, and several assumptions are stated axiomatically.  
- No full CAMB/CLASS likelihood analyses are included; falsifiability is demonstrated through scaffolds rather than data fitting.  
- References emphasize both foundational and modern debates: Verlinde (2011), Susskind (1995), Bousso (2002), Padmanabhan (2012–2020), Jacobson (1995), Banks and Fischler (holographic cosmology).

## Why It Matters

Waveframe v4.0 demonstrates that **methodology can be as important as results**. By freezing a research artifact that is auditable, transparent, and reproducible, it shows how independent work can be made credible outside traditional academic institutions.  

This is valuable both as:  

1. A **case study in AI assisted reproducible research**.  
2. A **conceptual sketch in cosmology**, offering testable hypotheses that could be developed in future work.  

The falsifiability scaffolds are designed to connect with upcoming and ongoing surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST, making the framework auditable against real data as it emerges.

## Skills Demonstrated

Waveframe v4.0 highlights a set of transferable skills that extend beyond cosmology:

- **AI workflow design** — building a structured orchestration framework for reproducible research.  
- **Reproducibility and auditability** — implementing logs, version histories, and falsifiability criteria with permanent archival.  
- **Scientific communication** — preparing transparent documentation that balances exploratory theory with methodological clarity.  
- **Research software practices** — using Git, DOI archiving, structured repositories, and open licensing to align with open science standards.  

These skills position the project not only as an experiment in physics but also as a model of how AI assisted research can be conducted and presented in any domain.

## Author’s Note

Waveframe v4.0 is archived as a frozen release. It will not undergo further major revisions, though minor polish may be applied. Future development continues in Waveframe XR and subsequent versions, where the focus shifts toward formalizing observer ontology and discrete information substrates.  

This project is part of a broader portfolio exploring **AI Workflow Orchestration** across both scientific and business domains.
