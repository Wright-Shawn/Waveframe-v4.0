Waveframe v4.0: AI-Orchestrated Proof of Concept in Cosmology

Overview

Waveframe v4.0 is a proof-of-concept cosmological framework built through a multi-threaded, AI-assisted research process with continuous human oversight. It replaces the metric-first assumptions of ΛCDM with an entropy–action, observer-driven expansion law, treating observation itself as the generator of spacetime.

This project was not created from a single prompt, but through hundreds of iterative inputs, cross-model critiques, and synthesis steps — managed like parallel R&D streams. The outcome is a mathematically explicit, falsifiable model, fully documented and version-controlled.

While speculative in physics, the primary purpose of Waveframe v4.0 is to showcase AI Workflow Designer skillsets:
	•	Parallel Prompt Orchestration – Managing separate threads for derivations, critiques, predictions, and documentation.
	•	Human-in-the-Loop Validation – Filtering, merging, and refining AI outputs into coherent results.
	•	Numerical Analysis Implementation – Running comparative model-vs-ΛCDM calculations locally in Python.
	•	Reproducible Documentation – Delivering a structured GitHub repository with transparent methods and results.

Why It Matters

Waveframe v4.0 demonstrates how complex, interdisciplinary research can be executed with limited hardware and resources by combining:
	•	Clear theoretical framing
	•	Modular development structure
	•	Transparent falsifiability criteria
	•	Fully reproducible outputs

Recruiters and technical reviewers will find:
	•	A working example of AI-human research orchestration from concept to deliverables
	•	End-to-end traceability of methods, inputs, and outputs
	•	Demonstrated ability to manage complexity under constraints

Core Features
	•	Entropy–Action Formalism – Links horizon entropy, observer information, and causal boundaries.
	•	Observer-Driven Expansion – H(t) ∝ 1 / √(t − t₀), with S(t) = π / H(t)².
	•	Limit-Case Recovery – Reduces to ΛCDM and prior Waveframe models under defined conditions.
	•	Falsifiability Built-In – Defines measurable deviations in CMB, BAO, and structure growth.

Method Limitations
	•	All calculations were run locally, without CAMB/CLASS or external datasets.
	•	CMB and BAO differences are distance-only proxies; full refinement would require Boltzmann solver integration.
	•	This project is not a replacement for ΛCDM, but a demonstration of AI-assisted scientific workflow execution.
