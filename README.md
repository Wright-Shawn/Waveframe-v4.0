# Waveframe v4.0: AI-Orchestrated Proof of Concept in Cosmology

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16872200.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16872200)

## Overview

Waveframe v4.0 is a proof-of-concept cosmological framework created through a multi-threaded, AI-assisted research process with continuous human oversight. It replaces the metric-first assumptions of ΛCDM with an entropy–action, observer-driven expansion law, treating observation itself as the generator of spacetime.

This project did not emerge from a single “magic prompt.”
It was built through hundreds of iterative inputs, cross-model critiques, and synthesis steps, managed like parallel R&D streams. The result is a mathematically explicit, falsifiable model — packaged in a structured, version-controlled GitHub repository.

While speculative in physics, the primary purpose of Waveframe v4.0 is to demonstrate AI Workflow Designer skillsets:

 •	Parallel Prompt Orchestration – Managing separate threads for derivations, critiques, predictions, and documentation.

 •	Human-in-the-Loop Validation – Filtering, merging, and refining AI outputs into coherent results.

 •	Numerical Analysis Implementation – Running model-vs-ΛCDM comparisons locally in Python under hardware constraints.

 •	Reproducible Documentation – Delivering clear, traceable methods and results.

## Why It Matters

Waveframe v4.0 demonstrates how complex, interdisciplinary research can be executed with limited resources by combining:
	•	Well-defined theoretical framing
	•	Modular development structure
	•	Built-in falsifiability criteria
	•	Complete, reproducible outputs

Recruiters and technical reviewers will find:
	•	A working example of AI-human research orchestration from concept to deliverables
	•	End-to-end traceability of methods, inputs, and outputs
	•	Demonstrated ability to manage complexity under constraints

## Core Tenets
	1.	Observer-defined horizons replace the idea of a single, global geometry.
	•	An observer’s “universe” is bounded by their causal horizon, an information boundary rather than a fixed metric surface.

 2.	Spacetime is emergent, not fundamental.
	•	Matter and geometry arise from quantum collapse events on causal surfaces.

 3.	Entropy = Horizon Area defines the system’s information content:
	•	S(t) = π / [H(t)]², where H(t) is the observer’s Hubble parameter (in s⁻¹).

 4.	Expansion emerges from resolution-dependent information intake:
	•	H(t) ∝ 1 / √(t − t₀), where t₀ is the observer’s reference start time for measurement.

 5.	Field equations are replaced with an information-action principle.
	•	Dynamics follow entropy growth and causal boundary changes instead of curvature.

 6.	The metric tensor is replaced by an entropic structure tied to causal boundaries.

## Research Goals
	•	Show that an AI-orchestrated workflow can produce a fully-formed cosmological framework, complete with derivations, predictions, and falsifiability criteria.

 •	Derive standard cosmological observables from an entropy-first, observer-limited perspective.

 •	Recover ΛCDM behaviors in stated limits without scalar fields, Λ, or inflation.

 •	Predict measurable deviations in CMB, BAO, and structure growth.

 •	Package the work in a transparent, reproducible repository for technical review.

## Falsifiability Criteria

Waveframe v4.0 is designed to be testable. The following pass/fail tests are non-negotiable:
	1.	BBN Constraints –
Match ΛCDM within ≈5% for cosmic temperatures 0.1–10 MeV to preserve observed light-element abundances.
	2.	CMB Acoustic Peaks –
Reproduce ΛCDM sound horizon and angular diameter distance at z ≈ 1100 within Planck error margins.
	3.	Distance–Redshift Relation –
Fit SN Ia and BAO data for H(z) and luminosity distance d_L(z) within observational uncertainties.
	4.	Growth of Structure –
Keep fσ₈(z) curves consistent with RSD and weak-lensing surveys.
	5.	Limit-Case Recovery –
Reduce to ΛCDM and prior Waveframe models under stated limits.
	6.	Unique Predictions –
Predict at least one measurable deviation not degenerate with existing dark-energy models.

If these fail under best-fit parameters, the model is considered empirically falsified.

## Method Limitations
	•	All calculations were run locally, without CAMB/CLASS or external datasets.
	•	CMB and BAO predictions are distance-only proxies; a full treatment would require Boltzmann solver integration.
	•	This work is not a replacement for ΛCDM, but a demonstration of AI-assisted scientific workflow execution.
