# Waveframe V4.0: Observer-Driven Cosmology Without Geometry

## Overview

**Waveframe V4.0** is a **speculative** cosmological framework that reimagines the foundations of spacetime, entropy, and expansion.  
It rejects classical geometric assumptions and proposes that the universe emerges through observer-limited information flow and entropy gradients.

Where Waveframe v3.1 modeled expansion as a macroscopic entropy gradient on the cosmological horizon, V4.0 goes further: it treats *observation itself* as the act that generates spacetime. Geometry is not fundamental — it is the visible trace of quantum collapse across a boundary of coherence. Expansion reflects an observer’s entropic rendering rate, not the stretching of a pre-existing metric.

This speculative model is grounded in formal derivations and falsifiable principles, offering a first-principles redefinition of cosmology through entropy and information — not a modification of general relativity.  
It is intended for theoretical physics researchers and advanced cosmology enthusiasts.

## Core Tenets

1. **Observer-defined horizons** replace the idea of a single, global geometry.  
   - An observer’s “universe” is bounded by their causal horizon, which is an information boundary rather than a fixed metric surface.

2. **Spacetime is emergent**, not fundamental.  
   - Matter and geometry arise from quantum collapse events on causal surfaces.

3. **Entropy = Horizon Area** defines the system’s information content:  
   - S(t) = π / [H(t)]², where H(t) is the observer’s Hubble parameter (in s⁻¹) and t is cosmic time.

4. **Expansion emerges** from resolution-dependent information intake:  
   - H(t) ∝ 1 / √(t − t₀), where t₀ is the observer’s reference start time for measurement.

5. **Field equations are replaced** with an **information-action principle**.  
   - Instead of curvature-based dynamics, evolution is driven by entropy growth and causal boundary changes.

6. The **metric tensor is replaced** by an entropic structure tied to causal boundaries.

## Research Goals

• Derive standard cosmological observables from an entropy-first, observer-limited framework  
• Replace Einstein’s field equations with an **information-action principle**  
• Recover ΛCDM behaviors in stated limits, with the goal of matching predictions for H(z), d_L(z), and fσ₈(z) without scalar fields, Λ, or inflation  
• Predict falsifiable anomalies — entropy discontinuities, rendering asymmetries, or causal structure distortions at high redshift  
• Formalize **causal surface merging** and holographic entropy continuity during structure formation

## Conceptual Highlights

• **Observation is expansion**: Each bit of acquired information increases the representable universe.  
• **Spacetime is rendered**: The universe emerges like resolution from a fractal — increasing entropy is increasing precision.  
• **Hubble flow = rendering rate**: The Hubble parameter encodes the rate of entropy acquisition, not recession velocity.
