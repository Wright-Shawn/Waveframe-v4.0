# Waveframe V4.0: Observer-Driven Cosmology Without Geometry

## Overview

**Waveframe V4.0** is a speculative cosmological framework that reimagines the foundations of spacetime, entropy, and expansion. It rejects classical geometric assumptions and proposes that the universe emerges through observer-limited information flow and entropy gradients.

Where Waveframe v3.1 modeled expansion as a macroscopic entropy gradient on the cosmological horizon, V4.0 goes further: it treats *observation itself* as the act that generates spacetime. Geometry is not fundamental — it is the visible trace of quantum collapse across a boundary of coherence. Expansion reflects an observer’s entropic rendering rate, not the stretching of a pre-existing metric.

This model is speculative, but structured around formal derivations and falsifiable principles. It is not a modification of general relativity — it is a first-principles redefinition of cosmology through entropy and information.

## Core Tenets

1. **Observer-defined horizons** replace global geometry.
2. **Entropy = Horizon Area** defines the system’s information content:  
   S(t) = π ÷ H(t)²
3. **Expansion emerges** from resolution-dependent information intake:  
   H(t) ∝ 1 ÷ √(t − t₀)
4. The **metric tensor is replaced** by an entropic structure tied to causal boundaries.
5. **No field equations** or energy-momentum tensors are used; expansion is not derived from curvature.
6. **Spacetime is emergent**, not fundamental. Matter and geometry arise from quantum collapse events on causal surfaces.

## Research Goals

• Derive standard cosmological observables from an entropy-first, observer-limited framework  
• Replace Einstein’s field equations with an **information-action principle**  
• Recover ΛCDM behaviors in stated limits, with the goal of matching predictions for H(z), d_L(z), and fσ₈(z) without scalar fields, Λ, or inflation  
• Predict falsifiable anomalies — entropy discontinuities, rendering asymmetries, or causal structure distortions at high redshift  
• Formalize **causal surface merging** and holographic entropy continuity during structure formation

## Conceptual Highlights

• **Observation is expansion**: Each bit of acquired information increases the representable universe.  
• **Spacetime is rendered**: The universe emerges like resolution from a fractal — increasing entropy is increasing precision.  
• **Hubble flow = rendering rate**: The Hubble parameter encodes the rate of entropy acquisition, not recession velocity.
