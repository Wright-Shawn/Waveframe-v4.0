# Waveframe XR: Observer-Driven Cosmology Without Geometry

## Overview

Waveframe XR (v4.0) is a foundational overhaul of the Waveframe cosmological framework. It departs from classical geometric formulations entirely and proposes that spacetime itself is not fundamental, but emerges from quantum information collapse at the observational boundary of an entity's light cone.

Where Waveframe v3.1 modeled expansion as a macroscopic entropy gradient on the horizon, XR models observation as an active process that generates spacetime. Geometry is a byproduct of resolution, and expansion reflects an observer's entropic rendering rate.

This project is speculative but rooted in rigorous formal principles. It is not an extension of general relativity, but a redefinition of cosmology from first informational principles.

## Core Tenets

1. Observer-defined horizons replace global geometry.
2. Entropy = Horizon Area defines system information content:
   S(t) = π ÷ H(t)²
3. Expansion law emerges from resolution-dependent information intake — the act of observation drives evolution:
   H(t) ∝ 1 ÷ √(t − t₀)
4. Metric tensor is replaced by an entropic structure tied to perceived causal boundaries.
5. No field equations or energy-momentum tensors are used. Expansion is not derived from curvature but from informational degrees of freedom.
6. Spacetime is emergent, not fundamental. Matter and geometry are encoded as quantum collapse events at a boundary of coherence.

## Research Goals

• Derive standard cosmological observables from an observer-limited entropy framework.  
• Replace the Einstein field equations with an information-action principle.  
• Reproduce ΛCDM-compatible H(z), d_L(z), and fσ₈(z) predictions without invoking a scalar field, cosmological constant, or inflation.  
• Provide falsifiable predictions regarding entropy discontinuities and rendering anomalies at high redshift.  
• Formalize the concept of causal surface merging and holographic entropy continuity during structure formation.  

## Conceptual Highlights

• **Observation is expansion**: Each bit of information acquired by a bounded observer expands the representable space.  
• **Rendering spacetime**: The universe is a progressive collapse into higher resolution, like rendering pixels from a fractal seed.  
• **Hubble flow = rendering rate**: The Hubble parameter represents the entropic update rate, not velocity of recession.  

## Related Works

Waveframe XR builds on several speculative and rigorous precedents:  
• T. Jacobson, “Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State” (1995)  
• E. Verlinde, “Emergent Gravity and the Dark Universe” (2016)  
• T. Padmanabhan, “Gravitation: Foundations and Frontiers” (2010)  
• M. Matsueda, “Emergent Spacetime and Holographic Entropy” (2014)  
• S. Gao, “A critique of entropic gravity” (2010)  

These works laid the groundwork for interpreting spacetime and gravity as emergent phenomena. Waveframe XR attempts to extend these ideas into a coherent cosmological framework with falsifiable predictions.
