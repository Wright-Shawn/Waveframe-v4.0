# Observer Ontology and Causal Boundaries

## 1. Definition of an Observer
In Waveframe V4.0, an **observer** is any system capable of registering information by collapsing quantum states into definite outcomes within its causal horizon.  
This definition is **framework-agnostic** — it does not require biological consciousness.

Categories of observers:
1. **Consciousness-based** – Biological or artificial agents with subjective awareness.
2. **Quantum-system-based** – Any system whose internal states become correlated with external systems, inducing decoherence.
3. **Thermodynamic** – Systems that irreversibly record state information through entropy increase.

## 2. Causal Boundaries
An observer’s **causal boundary** is the surface beyond which no information can be registered due to the finite speed of information transfer.  
This is equivalent to a **personal horizon** in spacetime but defined without assuming a global metric.

Key properties:
- **Observer-relative** – Different observers have different boundaries.
- **Entropy-defined** – The information content within the boundary is proportional to its surface area:  
  S(t) = π / [H(t)]²
- **Dynamic** – Boundaries evolve as H(t) changes over time.

## 3. Distinguishing Between Models of Observation

| Model Type | Basis | Strengths | Limitations |
|------------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Consciousness-based | Requires awareness or perception | Intuitive for human-scale physics | Not universal |
| Quantum-system | Any system causing state collapse | Aligns with decoherence theory | Interpretation-dependent |
| Thermodynamic | Any system increasing entropy | Ties directly to physical laws | Can over-generalize |

## 4. Horizons and Causal Surfaces
- **Causal surfaces** are not fixed; they depend on the observer’s capacity to acquire and store information.
- Horizons form when incoming signal speed ≤ expansion-driven separation rate.
- The **merging of causal surfaces** during structure formation is treated in `07_structure_formation_from_entropy_merging.md`.

## 5. Implications for XR Cosmology
1. Every derivation in XR is **observer-local** — there is no universal spacetime backdrop.
2. Observable quantities (H, S, d_L, etc.) are defined **relative to the observer’s boundary**.
3. Cosmological predictions must be computed **per observer class**, then transformed into shared observables.
