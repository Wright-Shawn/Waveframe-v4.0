# Theory Folder — Waveframe v4.0

This folder contains the theoretical foundations, derivations, and conceptual framework for **Waveframe v4.0**.  
The documents are numbered to reflect their logical reading order, starting from the foundational principles and building toward predictions, tests, and connections to existing cosmological models.

## Purpose of This Folder
The **Theory/** directory is the conceptual backbone of Waveframe v4.0, providing the reasoning and derivations behind all equations and computational models found in the `Equations/` folder.

This ensures that all assumptions, derivations, and logical steps are documented for transparency, reproducibility, and peer review.
