# Cosmological Predictions and Falsifiability

## Purpose

This document describes the predictions made by Waveframe v4.0 and how they can be tested against real-world data.
The approach is the same one I’d apply in an AI workflow: define expected outputs, establish test conditions, and make it easy to reproduce the results.

## Core Predictions

The model makes measurable predictions for:

 1.	Hubble Expansion Rate (H(z))

•	Derived from the entropy–action master equation.

•	Matches ΛCDM only in specific limit cases (see 08_limit_cases_and_connection_to_LCDM.md).

•	Deviates at certain redshift ranges, which allows observational tests.

 2.	Structure Growth Rate (fσ₈(z))

•	Calculated from the model’s predicted expansion history.

•	Can be compared directly to galaxy survey data.

 3.	Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Signatures

•	Small changes in background anisotropy patterns may appear if the model’s geometry differs significantly from ΛCDM at early times.

⸻

## Falsifiability Criteria

The model should be considered ruled out if:
	
 •	Observed H(z) differs significantly from the model’s prediction outside the range of measurement uncertainty.
	
 •	Predicted structure growth rates disagree with survey measurements beyond statistical error bars.
	
 •	CMB data strongly prefers ΛCDM over the entropy–action approach in model selection tests (e.g., χ² or Bayesian evidence).

This is similar to setting unit tests for a machine learning model — if the predictions fall outside the defined tolerance ranges, the model fails.

## Testing Plan
	
 1.	Numerical Implementation

•	Scripts: hubble_entropy_growth.py and structure_growth.py (planned additions).

•	Data sources: public cosmology datasets (e.g., BOSS, Planck, DES).
	
 2.	Automated Validation

•	Python functions will compare predicted vs. observed values and output pass/fail summaries.

•	The process can be run end-to-end as a single pipeline.
	
 3.	Reproducibility

•	All data preprocessing, parameter values, and code versions will be documented so anyone can rerun the tests.

## Closing Note

This falsifiability plan turns Waveframe v4.0 from “just a theory” into a testable, reproducible model.
The same philosophy drives good AI workflows — measurable outputs, clear failure conditions, and transparent validation steps.
