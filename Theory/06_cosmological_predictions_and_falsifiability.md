# Cosmological Predictions and Falsifiability

## 1. Purpose
This document lays out the **testable consequences** of the Waveframe V4.0 framework and defines precise criteria for falsification.  
Predictions are expressed in terms of measurable cosmological quantities and linked directly to the XR model’s core principles.

## 2. Key Predictions

### 2.1 Hubble Parameter at High Redshift
- **Prediction**: For z > 2, H(z) shows a **flattening slope** compared to ΛCDM by ΔX.  
- **Reasoning**: The XR framework ties expansion rate to entropy acquisition, which scales differently than metric expansion.
- **Falsification**: If observed H(z) remains within 1σ of ΛCDM for all z > 2.

### 2.2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) Scale Drift
- **Prediction**: BAO scale drift < 0.2% per Gyr.
- **Falsification**: Drift > 0.5% per Gyr in any well-calibrated dataset.

### 2.3 Entropy Discontinuities
- **Prediction**: Observable discontinuity in inferred horizon entropy at z ≈ 6.
- **Reasoning**: Linked to large-scale causal surface merging during the end of reionization.
- **Falsification**: No detectable discontinuity at expected epoch.

### 2.4 Rendering Asymmetries
- **Prediction**: Measurable anisotropies in large-scale structure statistics when analyzed from different causal frames.
- **Falsification**: Perfect isotropy within observational sensitivity limits.

## 3. Observational Targets
- High-z galaxy surveys (JWST, Roman Space Telescope).
- BAO measurements (DESI, Euclid).
- CMB secondary anisotropy mapping (SPT, ACT).
- 21cm tomography for reionization-era entropy mapping.

## 4. Falsification Table

| Test | Predicted Outcome | Data That Would Falsify |
|------|------------------|-------------------------|
| H(z) @ z>2 | Flattening slope by ΔX | Within 1σ of ΛCDM |
| BAO scale drift | Δ<0.2% / Gyr | Δ>0.5% / Gyr |
| Entropy discontinuity | Presence at z≈6 | No discontinuity |
| Rendering asymmetries | Detectable anisotropy | No anisotropy detected |

## 5. Importance of Falsifiability
Waveframe V4.0’s credibility hinges on making **risky predictions** that could be proven wrong.  
If all predictions fail, the model should be abandoned or fundamentally revised.
