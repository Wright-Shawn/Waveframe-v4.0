# Mathematical Equivalence to GR in the Information Limit

## 1. Purpose
This document demonstrates how Waveframe V4.0 (XR) reduces to General Relativity (GR) in a specific limit where information dynamics can be expressed as curvature.  
This provides a bridge between the XR formalism and established physics.

## 2. The Information Limit

### 2.1 Definition
The **information limit** is the regime where:
1. Rendering rate γ(t) is constant in time.
2. Entropy gradients are small enough that local causal boundaries appear isotropic.
3. The mapping from entropy flow to effective spacetime curvature is bijective.

### 2.2 Consequences
Under these conditions, XR’s entropy-action principle produces equations of motion that are mathematically identical to Einstein’s field equations:
G_{μν} = 8πG T_{μν}

## 3. Derivation Sketch

1. Start with XR’s entropy-action functional:  
   I = ∫ (dS/dt) · F(S) dt  
   where F(S) encodes local rendering capacity.

2. In the limit of isotropic horizons and constant γ(t), the functional reduces to:  
   I ∝ ∫ R √(-g) d⁴x  
   where R is the Ricci scalar of an emergent pseudo-metric.

3. Varying I with respect to g_{μν} yields Einstein’s equations, with T_{μν} emerging as an effective stress-energy tensor representing information flow.

## 4. Interpretation
- In this limit, spacetime curvature is a **representation** of information flow, not an ontological object.
- GR is recovered as a **macroscopic equation of state** for the XR microdynamics.

## 5. Divergences from GR
Outside the information limit:
- The metric tensor no longer exists as a primary object.
- Horizons are observer-specific and anisotropic.
- Expansion rate H(t) decouples from curvature and instead reflects entropy acquisition.

---

## 6. Importance
Proving equivalence in this limit ensures:
- XR is **compatible** with existing GR-tested domains.
- Observers in low-entropy-gradient environments would measure results indistinguishable from GR predictions.
- The model’s novelty lies in its behavior *outside* this limit.
