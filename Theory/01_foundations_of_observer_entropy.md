Foundations of Observer Entropy

## 1. Informational Horizons

We define the **informational horizon** as the boundary beyond which no observer can resolve further degrees of freedom, due to finite entropy. The informational horizon radius R(t) is defined as:

  R(t) = √(A(t) / 4π)  where A(t) = 4 · S(t)

Here, S(t) is the total observable entropy accessible to the observer at time t, and A(t) is the associated informational area. This defines a scale-dependent limit on observable resolution.

The scale R(t) acts as the rendering limit of the universe — not a causal boundary, but an _informational_ one.

## 2. Entropy as the Generator of Cosmological Dynamics

Instead of assuming a spacetime manifold, we define **dynamics as entropy gradients** between successive observer states. Let:

  dS/dt > 0

represent the arrow of time and a necessary condition for expansion. We then define the modified expansion law:

  Ḣ(t) = −γ(z) · H(t)² · (1 + z)

where γ(z) is a redshift-dependent entropy scaling function. The dynamics arise not from the Einstein field equations but from:

  (ΔS / Δt) ⇒ rendering pressure

This replaces geometric curvature as the source of expansion with entropic evolution.

## 3. Relation to Metric Geometry

In this model, **geometry is a derived construct**. The metric is not fundamental but emergent from the ordering of informational states constrained by entropy. The Hubble flow is interpreted as a rendering rate, and time is a consequence of entropy differentials.

This formulation permits reinterpretation of standard cosmological observables — including redshift, distance measures, and H(z) — as emergent from entropy bounds rather than fixed geometrical spacetime.

## 4. Observer-Centric Axioms

We begin with a minimal set of axioms:

1. The observer has access to finite entropy S(t) at any time t.
2. Observable reality is a projection of this entropy-constrained information.
3. Expansion occurs as a result of increasing informational capacity (dS/dt > 0).
4. The rendering limit R(t) defines the observable universe at each time.

All cosmological consequences must follow from this observer-entropic base.
