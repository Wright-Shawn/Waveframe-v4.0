## Foundations of Observer-Driven Entropy

### 1. Postulate: Observation as Entropic Resolution

We begin with the premise that **observation itself generates entropy** through the act of resolving indistinguishable microstates. The observer imposes informational constraints on an otherwise ambiguous quantum substrate. In this view:

- Let \( S(t) \) represent the entropy **accessible** to an observer at time \( t \),
- Let \( H(t) \) be the Hubble-like expansion variable not derived from the metric, but emergent from entropy growth.

We propose the following definition:

\[
S(t) = \frac{\pi}{H(t)^2}
\]

This is consistent with horizon entropy in natural units and proposes that resolution defines the observable universe.

### 2. Informational Horizon: Definition

Define the *informational horizon* as the maximal boundary beyond which no further resolution is achievable given current entropy \( S(t) \). Formally:

\[
R(t) = \sqrt{\frac{A(t)}{4\pi}} \quad \text{where} \quad A(t) = 4S(t)
\]

The scale \( R(t) \) acts as the rendering limit of the universe â€” not a causal boundary, but an *informational one*.

### 3. Entropy as the Generator of Cosmological Dynamics

Instead of assuming a spacetime manifold, we define **dynamics as entropy gradients** between successive observer states. Let:

\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} > 0
\]

represent the arrow of time and a necessary condition for expansion. We then define the modified expansion law:

\[
\dot{H}(t) = -\frac{\gamma(z) H(t)^2}{1 + z}
\]

where \( \gamma(z) \) is a redshift-dependent entropy scaling function. The dynamics arise not from the Einstein field equations but from:

\[
\frac{\delta S}{\delta t} \Rightarrow \text{rendering pressure}
\]

### 4. Relation to Metric Geometry

In this model, **geometry is a derived construct**. The traditional metric \( g_{\mu\nu} \) is a coarse approximation to the true informational state of the universe. Instead of postulating curvature, we define:

\[
\text{Curvature} \propto \frac{1}{S(t)}
\]

This inverts the usual approach: geometry arises from entropy, not the other way around.

### 5. Implications and Testable Claims

1. **Non-metric emergence**: Predicts deviations from standard FLRW dynamics at low entropy regimes (early universe).
2. **Entropy growth predicts H(z)**: The redshift-dependent entropy model can be fitted directly to observational H(z) data.
3. **Entropy horizon drift**: Observable horizons are predicted to scale with \( R(t) \), potentially altering distance ladder calibrations.

### 6. Next Steps

- Formalize \( \gamma(z) \) from thermodynamic principles
- Replace \( g_{\mu\nu} \) with entropy curvature tensor
- Define observer-relative time \( \tau_O \) and its relation to \( t \)
- Link entropy rendering rate with structure formation
