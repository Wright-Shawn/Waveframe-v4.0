# Hubble Parameter as Rendering Rate

## Conceptual Overview

In the Waveframe XR framework, the Hubble parameter \( H(t) \) is not treated as a measure of recessional velocity derived from metric expansion. Instead, it reflects the observer's **rendering rate** — the rate at which new spatial degrees of freedom become observable due to entropy intake.

Each observation-driven entropy update results in an expansion of the representable universe within the observer's causal horizon. This reinterprets cosmological redshift not as a stretching of space, but as a progressive collapse into increasingly fine-grained states of resolution.

## Modified Expansion Law

The proposed evolution law for the Hubble parameter is:

    H(t) ∝ 1 / √(t − t₀)

Where:

- `t` is cosmological time as measured by the observer.
- `t₀` is the onset time of coherent observation — a minimum temporal reference point.

This form ensures:

- **No initial singularity** at t = t₀.
- **Monotonic decay**, implying slowing expansion as information resolution increases.
- **Consistency with entropy scaling**, as larger entropy intake per time unit reduces the expansion rate.

## Derivation from Entropy

Define the entropy of the observer’s causal horizon as:

    S(t) = π / H(t)²

Taking the time derivative:

    dS/dt = −2π (Ḣ) / H³

Assuming entropy grows proportionally with an observational intake function γ(z):

    dS/dt ∝ γ(z)

Rewriting in terms of Hubble parameter:

    −2π (Ḣ) / H³ ∝ γ(z)

Which implies:

    Ḣ ∝ −γ(z) H³

Solving this differential equation yields:

    H(t) ∝ 1 / √(t − t₀)   (under constant γ(z))

This places H(t) within a first-principles derivation based on information intake.

## Interpretational Shift

In standard ΛCDM cosmology:

    H(t) measures the fractional expansion rate: H = ȧ / a

In Waveframe XR:

    H(t) measures the entropy-resolution rate — the observer’s rate of entropic assimilation across a bounded causal surface.

Thus:

    - **Acceleration** implies a spike in observational entropy (e.g. sudden coherence gain).
    - **Deceleration** implies entropy saturation or horizon boundary stabilization.

This dynamic avoids a cosmological constant, scalar field, or inflationary period — replacing them with a first-person information metric.

## Consequences for Redshift

Redshift arises from differential rendering rates between past and present observer states.

Let:

    z ∝ ΔS / S

Then redshift is tied not to expansion, but to change in entropy resolution across emission and detection events.

This framework opens the possibility for predicting redshift anomalies based on discontinuous jumps in entropy (e.g. during phase transitions or horizon mergers).

## Summary

    - H(t) is an entropic rendering rate, not a spacetime velocity field.
    - It is derived from entropy-action formalism, avoiding singularities and dark energy.
    - Redshift becomes a signature of entropy resolution rather than Doppler motion.
    - This reformulation paves the way for falsifiable predictions distinct from ΛCDM.
