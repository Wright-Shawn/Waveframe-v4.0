# Emergent Spacetime Dynamics

## Overview

In the Waveframe XR framework, spacetime is not a fundamental arena but an emergent structure that arises from informational processes. Specifically, we propose that spacetime geometry manifests from entropy gradients generated by observation. Each act of observation is equivalent to a resolution update within a bounded region defined by causal limits.

The observer does not passively traverse spacetime — the observer's act of acquiring information *produces* spacetime.

## Informational Collapse and Causal Boundaries

We define an observer as a bounded, information-coherent system, constrained by its causal horizon. Within this horizon:

- Collapse events define updates to the observer's internal entropy.
- Entropy gradients define perceived distances and durations.

This implies:

Δx² ∝ ΔS / ∂ₓS  
Δt² ∝ ΔS / ∂ₜS

These relations replace traditional metric interval definitions, treating resolution changes as the generative source of spacetime coordinates.

## Expansion as Entropic Rendering

Let H(t) represent the observer's entropic rendering rate. We postulate:

S(t) = π / H(t)²  
⇒ H(t) ∝ 1 / √(t − t₀)

This expansion law does not result from curvature but from the rate at which information can be acquired and resolved.

## No Global Geometry

In XR, the global spacetime manifold is replaced by localized entropy-defined patches. These patches evolve based on observer-limited informational intake. Consequently, continuity and connectedness of space emerge only *after* decoherent regions merge via entropy threshold mechanisms.

## Consequences

1. **Structure Formation:** No need for dark matter seeding; structure arises from entropy-coherent regions merging.
2. **No Metric Tensor:** Geometry is encoded in entropy gradients.
3. **Observable Anomalies:** Discontinuities in entropy may produce redshift anomalies or anisotropies.

## Next

The next theoretical entry will introduce the entropy-action formalism and its role as a replacement for Einstein’s field equations.
