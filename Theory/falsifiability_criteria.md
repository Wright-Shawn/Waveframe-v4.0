# Falsifiability Checklist — Waveframe v4.0

## Purpose

This is a quick-reference guide for testing whether the Waveframe v4.0 model holds up against real-world data.
It’s built like a quality-assurance checklist you’d see in AI model development — clear criteria, easy to rerun, and results that are straightforward to interpret.

⸻

## 1. Define What the Model Predicts

 •	Hubble Expansion Rate (H(z)) from entropy–action equations

 •	Structure Growth (fσ₈(z)) from model-derived expansion history

 •	Optional: CMB Pattern Shifts relative to ΛCDM baseline

⸻

## 2. Select Real-World Data Sources

 •	Galaxy survey expansion data (BOSS, DES, eBOSS)

 •	Structure growth measurements from redshift-space distortions

 •	CMB anisotropy maps (Planck, WMAP)

⸻

## 3. Implement the Tests

 •	Compute predictions using Python scripts (hubble_entropy_growth.py, structure_growth.py)

 •	Align observed and predicted data over matching redshift bins

 •	Calculate statistical measures (χ², residuals, Bayesian evidence)

⸻

## 4. Apply Pass/Fail Conditions

 •	H(z) matches observations within measurement error margins

 •	fσ₈(z) predictions align within observational uncertainties

 •	CMB preference score does not strongly reject Waveframe v4.0 compared to ΛCDM

⸻

## 5. Automate for Reproducibility

 •	Create a single pipeline script to run all tests in sequence

 •	Use configuration files (YAML/JSON) for parameter tuning

 •	Store results in a versioned output directory for tracking

⸻

## Outcome

If the model fails one or more of these tests in a statistically significant way, it should be considered falsified under the current assumptions.
If it passes, the result is not “proof” but increased confidence — the same standard applied to AI models during performance validation.

⸻

This format not only makes it easier for others to run the tests, but also shows a systems-thinking approach that’s directly applicable to AI workflow roles.
