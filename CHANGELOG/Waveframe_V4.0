# Waveframe v4.0 — Entropy–Action Cosmology

Waveframe v4.0 is the unifying synthesis of all prior versions of the Waveframe Hypothesis.  
It introduces a foundational entropy–action formalism from which both the scalar-field cosmologies of v1.0–v2.0 and the entropy-driven models of v3.x emerge as special cases.

This marks the first time the Waveframe framework has been expressed as a single theoretical structure that:
- Reproduces ΛCDM as a limit case.
- Recovers the oscillatory scalar-field dynamics of v1.0–v2.0 from the entropy–action principle under appropriate constraints.
- Embeds the pure informational/thermodynamic laws of v3.x within a broader variational formulation.

## Key Advances over v3.1

- **Entropy–Action Derivation**  
  A full variational formalism where the action is defined in terms of horizon entropy, observer information, and causal boundary conditions.

- **Emergent Spacetime Dynamics**  
  Time and geometry arise from entropy gradients, with equations directly linking horizon area growth to the metric expansion rate.

- **Hubble Law from Entropy Growth**  
  Derives the Hubble parameter as a rendering rate of spacetime information, yielding the standard Hubble law as a limit while predicting deviations in specific regimes.

- **Structure Formation from Entropy Merging**  
  New mechanism for the growth of cosmic structure based on the aggregation of informational degrees of freedom, consistent with standard perturbation theory in the ΛCDM limit.

- **Limit Case Mapping**  
  Explicit demonstration of how v4.0 recovers:
  - ΛCDM (flat and curved cases)
  - v1.0/v2.0 scalar-field cosmologies
  - v3.x entropy-growth models

- **Philosophical & Observational Bridge**  
  Provides a conceptual through-line from thermodynamics and information theory to measurable cosmological parameters.

## Why v4.0 Matters

v4.0 is not a replacement for earlier models — it is their parent theory.  
By grounding cosmic dynamics in a generalized entropy–action principle, Waveframe now:
- Explains why the earlier models work.
- Connects cosmology to deeper information-theoretic and thermodynamic laws.
- Retains falsifiability by linking all results to observable quantities such as H(z), μ(z), and fσ₈(z).

This release represents the most comprehensive and foundational statement of the Waveframe program to date — a single theory that unites scalar-field physics, pure entropy cosmology, and ΛCDM within one coherent mathematical framework.
