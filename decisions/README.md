# Decisions — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** for Waveframe v4.0.  
Each ADR documents a key tradeoff in the project, making the workflow **transparent and auditable**.

## Purpose
The goal is not only to track *what* was done, but *why* it was done.  
Together with the [Workflow Log](../WORKFLOW_LOG.md) and [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md), these ADRs form the project’s **audit trail**.

## Format of an ADR
Each ADR follows a simple template:

- **Context** — the problem or choice point  
- **Decision** — what was chosen  
- **Status** — accepted, rejected, or superseded  
- **Consequences** — impacts and tradeoffs  
- **Related Artifacts** — links to logs, figures, or files  

Example:
```markdown
# ADR 000X: Title

- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Status: Accepted
- Context: …
- Decision: …
- Consequences: …
- Related Artifacts: …
